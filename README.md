# Exploit Scripts
This repository contains a variety of scripts used to exploit
systems. The exploitation phase of penetration testing occurs
after the recon/enumeration phase and it is during this phase
that vulnerabilities discovered within the environment are exploited
to secure additional access or increase privileges.

This repository is fairly free-form and will contain a variety of
exploits. The intention of this repository is to hold one-off, 
single-file scripts rather than large exploit modules (those 
should be in their own repository).
